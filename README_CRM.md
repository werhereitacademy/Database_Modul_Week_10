## Python-Module-Week7

* In this assignment, you are expected to complete the interface of the Python module graduation project on the page https://werhere-it-academy.gitbook.io/werhere-it-academy-handbook/python-modulu/modul-project/crm.v2 with an original work.

## Interface login window
* Create a customized login page for the application. This page contains the following features
1. Two separate input elements for user and password.
2. It will react to these two pieces of information and click the next entry button.
3. A warning text to indicate whether the button was successful or not when clicked.
* Optionally, you can add another button to close the application and remove the window image.
* Create a customized login window using consistent background colors, box edge shapes, button features (hover, pressed, rounded edge), different fonts and colors for texts.
* Tip: By placing a frame first and placing the elements on it, you can create a dynamic dimension for both the frame and the elements you place on it by using layout and spacer.

## Preference-Menu
* It should show three buttons that will direct a user to three different windows when he/she logs in successfully.
1. Applications The menu-applications button should direct the user to the first application window.
2. Mentor Meeting - the mentor meeting button should direct the user to the mentor window.
3.Interviews - the interviews button should direct the user to the interviews window
4. Add a Close button to exit the application.
* Differentiate this from the previous input window in a consistent way (colour, format, etc.).

5. A 7-column table that will allow the data to be called by the three buttons at the top to be displayed on the screen in the form of columns and rows when called.
6. Return to Preferences Screen Button - A button that will allow you to return to the Preferences Menu. Note: If the person logged in is admin, it should return to the Preferences-Admin Screen.
* Each window design should be consistently differentiated from other window designs (colour, shape, frame border colors of buttons, transparent background color of the table, etc.).
* Depending on your busy schedule, you can also add separate buttons showing VIT1 and VIT2 file records here.
* Again, differentiate this page from other pages in a consistent way (color, format, frame border colors of buttons, transparent background color of the table, etc.).

1. Search button and Input box - a box to enter text and a button to which we will add the search function
2. All Conversations - This is a button that will call all the data in the Mentor File into the table.
3. Multiple tabs - add a tool that opens down when hovered over, showing multiple options. Tip: Combobox>Edit Items. Note: You can find Multi-Tab data on page 2 of the Mentor File! This tab functions to print the data in the relevant column in the Mentor File to the screen.
* hint: Combobox > Edit Items
4. Return to Preferences Screen button.
Note: If the logged in person is admin, he/she should go back to Preferences-Admin Screen.

* You can delete the window image around each page and replace it with a button to close the application.

## Admin Menu
1. Event Registration Button
When the Event Recording Button is clicked, the records of the Events in Google Calendar should be displayed. It is up to your preference to add e-mail addresses, meeting location, etc. features here. The format was created as Meeting Title, Start Time, participant e-mail address and organizer e-mail address.
2. Mail Button
When you click on the Mail Button, e-mails should be sent to the e-mail addresses registered in the events in Google Calendar. If preferred, the e-mail delivered information can also be displayed on the screen as a message.
